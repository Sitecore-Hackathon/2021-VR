# TEAM VR  : BYOD - Object Detection App
  

### ⟹ [SetupGuide](ENTRYFORM.md) <<
### ⟹ [UsageGuide](ENTRYFORM.md) <<

## Intro :

As we are now familiar with a lot of AI tools that allow users classify & Tag images but they are mostly limited to a General Dataset - mostly realy world tags like Person, Vehicle, Animal etc. * It takes a huge effort to custom train specific images - let's say images related to a product line **( yes - we have trained to predict Apple Products.)**.
#### So we took this initiative to drive a BYOD pipeline using Sitecore and Headless Service !

## Value add : 
We think this could be of great use as the dataset is created by end users who master their product line and so they can easily build their own ! We then do the difficult part of training it. It can also be coupled with Sitecore.ai and could serve as a tagging service for Content Hub. You can think of so many different use cases !

## Tools Used :
 
 We hava a created **'Build Your Own Dataset'** for Object Detection in Images app using 

  - Sitecore & .net core SDK
  - [Custom Vision Ai](https://www.customvision.ai/)
  - [Vott Tool (Visual Object Tagging Tool)](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT)
  - Azure Blob Storage - To store images and vott project

## A Brief Workflow :

A short summary on how the whole custom data set training is done.

Upload Image |Tag Image|Export|Train & Predict
:--------------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:--------------------
Upload image in Custom Folder Within Sitecore  |Tag Image Using VOTT tool which is mounted as external tool and can be accessed from Launchpad|Once images are tagged - click export button that exports to CustomVision.ai|Finally goto Train page - provide a name for your model and click train. Once the model is available, Predictions can be done !

## Docker Setup

- run ./init.ps1 -LicenseXmlPath 'Provide-your-Sitecore-Path'
- run ./Start.ps1 to build and run containers.
- run ./Stop.ps1 to stop containers

## App Setup

App setup is not as easy like the docker - in short you need,

- Azure Blob Storage - to store and process image in VOTT tool
- Custom AI acoount and Api keys

Please follow this document which has clear Setup Instructions

## User Guide

It is quite like the workflow table but please follow this document on how to work on it.
